Composite Alpha Power Analysis Example - Real-time EEG Alpha Band Processing

This example demonstrates a complete alpha power analysis pipeline that
simulates ps EEG data with modulated alpha activity and processes it
through multiple signal processing stages. It showcases g.Pype features
including signal generation, filtering, power computation, and multi-channel
visualization.

What this example shows:
- Pseudo EEG signal simulation with modulated alpha activity
- Alpha band filtering (8-12 Hz) for brain rhythm analysis
- Power extraction using signal squaring
- Temporal smoothing with moving averages
- Data decimation for computational efficiency
- Multi-stage pipeline visualization with Router node
- Real-time processing of neurophysiological signals

Pipeline architecture:
1. Signal Generation: Creates 8-channel noise + alpha modulation
2. Alpha Filtering: Extracts 8-12 Hz frequency band
3. Power Analysis: Computes instantaneous power (signal squared)
4. Temporal Smoothing: Moving average for stable power estimates
5. Data Reduction: Decimation for efficient downstream processing
6. Multi-channel Display: Router combines all processing stages

Expected behavior:
When you run this example:
- Opens time-series visualization showing 7 processing stages
- Channel 1: Raw noisy signal with modulated alpha
- Channel 2: 0.5 Hz modulation signal (low-frequency envelope)
- Channel 3: Modulated signal (noise × (1 + modulation))
- Channel 4: Alpha-filtered signal (8-12 Hz band)
- Channel 5: Instantaneous alpha power (squared signal)
- Channel 6: Smoothed alpha power (moving average)
- Channel 7: Decimated power (reduced sampling rate)

Real-world applications:
- EEG alpha rhythm analysis for neurofeedback systems
- Brain state monitoring and cognitive load assessment
- Sleep stage detection using alpha power dynamics
- Attention and relaxation state classification
- Real-time BCI applications using alpha modulation
- Clinical EEG analysis for neurological assessment

Scientific background:
Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) are prominent EEG rhythms associated with:
- Relaxed wakefulness and eyes-closed states
- Attention regulation and cognitive processing
- Sensorimotor idle states and cortical inhibition
- Individual differences in cognitive performance
- Pathological changes in neurological disorders

Technical features:
- Realistic signal modeling with controlled alpha modulation
- Multi-stage filtering and power analysis pipeline
- Efficient data processing with decimation
- Real-time parameter monitoring across processing stages

Pipeline components explained:
- Generator: Creates controllable synthetic EEG-like signals
- Equation: Performs mathematical operations (modulation, power)
- Bandpass: Implements digital filtering for frequency selection
- MovingAverage: Temporal smoothing for stable estimates
- Decimator: Reduces data rate while preserving information
- Router: Combines multiple signals for comparative visualization
- TimeSeriesScope: Real-time multi-channel display
