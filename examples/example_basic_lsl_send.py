Basic LSL Send Example - Lab Streaming Layer Data Transmission

This example demonstrates how to stream data over the network using Lab
Streaming Layer (LSL) protocol. LSL is the standard for real-time data
exchange in neuroscience research, enabling communication between different
BCI applications, analysis tools, and recording systems.

What this example shows:
- Generating synthetic 8-channel EEG-like signals with noise
- Capturing keyboard events as experimental markers
- Merging signal and event data using Router
- Streaming combined data over LSL network protocol
- Headless operation (no GUI) for dedicated streaming applications

Expected behavior:
When you run this example:
- LSL stream becomes discoverable on the local network
- Other LSL applications can connect and receive the data stream
- Data includes 8 signal channels + 1 event channel
- Keyboard events are transmitted as numerical markers
- Console shows "Pipeline is running. Press enter to stop."

Network streaming details:
- Protocol: Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)
- Stream name: Automatically generated by LSLSender
- Data format: 9 channels (8 signals + 1 events)
- Sampling rate: 250 Hz
- Discovery: Automatic via LSL network protocol

Real-world applications:
- Multi-application BCI systems (data sharing between tools)
- Real-time analysis in separate applications (MATLAB, Python)
- Recording with third-party software (LSL Recorder)
- Distributed BCI systems across multiple computers
- Integration with analysis frameworks (EEGLAB, MNE-Python)
- Real-time feedback and visualization tools

Common LSL ecosystem:
- Data sources: g.Pype, OpenViBE, BCI2000, hardware drivers
- Data sinks: LSL Recorder, MATLAB LSL toolbox, MNE real-time
- Analysis tools: Real-time signal processing and classification
- Visualization: Real-time plotting and monitoring applications

Usage:
    1. Run: python example_basic_lsl_send.py
    2. Use LSL viewer or example_basic_lsl_receive.py to see the stream
    3. Press arrow keys to send event markers
    4. Press Enter in console to stop streaming

Prerequisites:
    - pylsl library installed (pip install pylsl)
    - Network connectivity for LSL discovery
