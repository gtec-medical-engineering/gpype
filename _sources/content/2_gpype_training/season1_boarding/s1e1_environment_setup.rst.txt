      Follow the steps below to set up your development environment. Note that
      you need a desktop or laptop computer with Windows or macOS to run g.Pype.
      Mobile environments (tablets, smartphones) are not yet supported. g.Pype does not require
      specialized hardware, but a reasonably modern system is recommended for optimal performance.
      Internet access is needed for downloading software but not for running g.Pype.

         .. grid-item-card:: Download Python

            Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest stable version. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

         .. grid-item-card:: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

            Next, we need an IDE. Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/ to download the latest stable version of VS Code. Install it following
            the instructions for your OS. Throughout this training, VS Code will be used, but feel free to use another editor if you prefer.

         .. grid-item-card:: Configure VS Code

            Launch VS Code and open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X). Search for and install the following extensions (latest versions):
            Python (by Microsoft) and Pylance (by Microsoft).

         .. grid-item-card:: Install g.Pype

            Open a terminal in VS Code and run ``pip install gpype``. This might take a couple of minutes, since all dependencies need to be installed
            as well. To verify the installation, execute ``gpype --version`` in the terminal. You should see the installed version of g.Pype.

      That's it! Four simple steps and you are ready to start using g.Pype. Proceed to the next episode to run your first pipeline.
